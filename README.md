# advent-of-code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar and can be solved using any programming language. Each puzzle is released at midnight in Eastern Standard Time and consists of two parts that must be solved in order. This repository hosts my solutions.

Years prior to 2021 will be completed over time, while 2021 onwards will hopefully be completed as per the Advent calendar.
